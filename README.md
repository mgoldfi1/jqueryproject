# README

  Welcome to the JQuery/Javascript/Rails diet-tracking web application.  The goal of this project was to create a web application with a Rails backend that uses Javascript and Jquery for the front-end.  
  This application is very easy to use.  First run bundle install to run all of the necessary Ruby Gems required in the gem-file.
  Once the bundle installation is complete, you can enter "Rails S" into the terminal, upon which Rails will automatically host your application locally at http://localhost:3000.

  Once the Rails Server is running, you can use the sign-up page to make an account.  All users will be stored in the database.  Once an account is made, you can check out the other features of the site.

  This project is more of a model than an actual website.  Ideally, you would have many users using the site because the concept behind it is meant to be social.
